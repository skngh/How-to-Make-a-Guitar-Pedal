# Learning resources

If you are feeling overwhelmed starting off, here are a few resources for each category that I found helpful when I began my journey. I think it would still be helpful to go through the course first, but these can be great afterwards

**Coding:**

- [Harvard's CS50](https://harvardonline.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science). This was my intro to programming course I did to get started. This would obviously be for those very serious about wanting to learn programming, but I promise if you get through it you will have a very strong foundation going forward. It is more than enough to get started building digital pedals!
- [Learn C++](https://www.learncpp.com/). This is a great online resource for learning C++. If you don't care for the more broad learning that something like CS50 will give you, resources like this are a great place to learn more targeted languages.
- [The Cherno C++ Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18c3MTX0PK0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb). Great youtube series that really gives in depth knowledge on how each little thing in C++ works. Great for if you're transitioning from another language that's higher level and you want a better explanation of how each thing works in the language.
- Just code! If you're just starting off, simple tutorials on the basic will suffice and then I recommend just jumping into fun projects (like pedals!). Since coding using something like the DaisySP library is fairly simple, it can really help building that foundation before writing your own DSP classes.

**DSP:**

- [The Scientiest and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing](https://www.dspguide.com/pdfbook.htm). This is a fantastic online resource that covers sooo many amazing DSP topics. If you can get through this you will be very well set going forward.
- [Will Pirkle books](https://www.willpirkle.com/). I haven't read these myself but hear great things about them. I believe they're more plugin focused.
- [The Audio Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/@TheAudioProgrammer). Great channel full of amazing lectures and courses all related to audio programming (obviously!). Most of the tutorials are about building plugins, which I highly recommend if you are trying to build pedals! Plugins can be just as fun, and most all the techniques apply to both.
- Learn math! If you want to unlock the true world of DSP, math is your best friend. You don't have to be an expert, or even that intermediate (I'm sure not), but I personally found I kept hitting walls because of my lack in math. I didn't have to take any math classes in college so I pretty much lost all my math knowledge. I found that [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is still a great resource, especially if you're regurarly applying math while programming. It may not be the best single resource, but as long as you're doing other steps to apply your teachings, it should work well. But my favorite math youtube channel is [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown).

**Electrical Engineering**

- There's many great channels out there that will just teach you the basics of different components and formulas. [The Engineering Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/@EngineeringMindset/videos) and [ElectroBOOM](https://www.youtube.com/@ElectroBOOM/videos) are two of the biggest ones.
- This is another massive field so the resources you want will depend on how deep you want to go. Starting off just getting familiar with different basic components and Ohms law will get you far. Eventually, I felt I needed a firmer background so I'm currently going through [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/crash-course-electronics-and-pcb-design/) Udemy course taught by Andre LaMothe, and really recommend it. It's definitely slow, coming in at around 100+ hours, but it's teaching me tons. [This book](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Electronics-Inventors-Fourth-Scherz/dp/1259587541) by Paul Scherz and Simon Monk has also been helpful, but it's definitely a bit dense if you're new
- If you're really just interested in microcontroller world, than simply finding fun arduino projects is always a good time and learning experience. A lot of that knowledge can apply to the Daisy Seed too! You could also venture into modular synth building world with the Daisy, which I can't recommend enough.
