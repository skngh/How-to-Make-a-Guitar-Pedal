Here are all the resources I mentioned throughout the course. This is not including any of the parts that we will be buying through Tayda Electronics or PCBWay, since I will go over buying them in each video. Those parts are linked up above.

## Equipment

### Required:

- [Daisy Seed](https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed?variant=45234245108004). This is the brain of our whole pedal. You will want the 65BB version for a pedal. Getting it unsoldered can save a few bucks if you're comfortable soldering.
- Basic electronics kit, like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/EL-CK-002-Electronic-Breadboard-Capacitor-Potentiometer/dp/B01ERP6WL4?sr=8-3), OR a Daisy prototyping board like the [Daisy Pod](https://electro-smith.com/products/pod), or the [Simple Fix Kit](https://www.synthux.academy/shop/simple-fix-kit). If you go the kit route then you will have to also get some basic components, such as audio jacks, knobs, and switches. If you get a prototyping board you won't have to worry about that, but I do strongly recommend going the breadboard route if you're new. You'll get a better understanding of how microcontrollers work, and it will be cheaper overall.
- Soldering iron + soldering tools (solder, sponge cleaner, steel wool etc.). You will need a soldering iron to solder and assemble the pedal in the end. If you have never soldered before, this will be a place you will have to learn a bit of before finishing the course, as I don't teach a full beginners guide on soldering. I will say, [this](https://www.amazon.com/Soldering-Kit-Temperature-Desoldering-Electronics/dp/B07GTGGLXN?sr=8-23) was the first soldering iron I bought, and it served me well enough for about a year before I upgraded, so don't think you need to buy something expensive if it's your first iron
- 22 gauge wire (preferably stranded but solid is fine). We'll have to hand wire our jacks and footswitch to the PCB, so wire is needed.

### Optional but handy:

- Misc. tools such as wirecutters, wire strippers, helping hands.
- Multimeter. You don't need anything fancy. If you're starting off a cheap Plusivo or similar brand would be fine. I've been using this [Klein Tools MM420](https://www.amazon.com/Multimeter-Auto-Ranging-Klein-Tools-MM420/dp/B0B57PFFYX?sr=8-1) for awhile now and haven't had any issues. If you plan on getting into electronics, this device is an absolute must for debugging and understanding your circuits.
