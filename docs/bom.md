# Bill of Materials (BOM)

> Prices are approximate and reflect a snapshot as of **January 2026** (excluding tax).

This is the BOM for the exact chorus pedal I make throughout the course. It won't fluctuate that much in price honestly (except for shipping), so this is a good reference point no matter how many knobs/switches you add. Since we order the enclosure/UV/drilling through Tayda, I'm going to list all parts from Tayda too.

_**The price factors in the quantity.**_

## BUY BULK MATERIALS!

If you're hoping to make more pedals after this, buy parts in bulk. Not only does the individual price drop when buying higher quantities, but shipping costs are also better dispersed. Once you have your PCB design finalized, you can order that layout in bulk and then do separate UV print designs for each pedal.

This can easily bring the per-pedal cost down to around $50, and even lower if you're making multiple units of the same design.

Either way, there's no reason not to buy many resistors, LEDs, pots, jacks etc. They are so cheap so you're simply saving money in the long run.
